# SHIT Linux
## Sam's Heckin Intermitent Tiny Linux
### What is?
It is a distro that removes the bloat from Ubuntu, replaces curl and wget with my swirl project, does not start up with a desktop (but you can start a XFCE session after logging in by the "startx" command), does NOT come with a browser, comes with an "add-flathub.sh" script, a "scrcpy.AppImage" binary, an "install-roblox-studio.sh" script, and replaces some of the bloated GNU coreutils with BusyBox utils. Also comes with flatpak.

### Download link pls?

### IMPORTANT NOTE

It is recommended for typical desktop use that you ***uncheck*** the LVM-related partition options in the initial install.
